# G20 Innovation Challenge – Water & Sanitation

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the ATL Marathon and G20 Innovation Challenge.  
It addresses two critical problems in India: the shortage of clean drinking water and unhygienic railway toilets.  

## Solutions
1. **Low-cost Desalination Unit**  
   - Solar-powered induction coil evaporates seawater.  
   - Steam is condensed and mineralized to provide drinkable water.  
   - Compact, low-maintenance design suitable for coastal deployment.  

2. **Automated Railway Sanitation System**  
   - Modified e-toilet system that self-cleans after each use.  
   - Uses caustic soda spray to dissolve waste, followed by water jets and air-drying fans.  
   - Includes a filtering and recycling unit to reuse water and reduce costs.
